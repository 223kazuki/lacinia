`boardgamegeek-graphql-proxy <https://github.com/hlship/boardgamegeek-graphql-proxy>`_
  Howard Lewis Ship created this simple proxy to expose part of the
  `BoardGameGeek <https://boardgamegeek.com/>`_ database as GraphQL, using Lacinia.

  It was used for examples in his
  Clojure/West 2017 talk: `Power to the (Mobile) People: Clojure and GraphQL <http://2017.clojurewest.org/clojure-graphql/>`_.
