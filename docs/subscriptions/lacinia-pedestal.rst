lacinia-pedestal
================

Lacinia can only lay the foundation for subscriptions; the web tier must be involved to create the long-lived connections
to support server-side push.

The `lacinia-pedestal <https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal>`_ companion library provides an
`implementation of subscriptions based on WebSockets <http://lacinia-pedestal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subscriptions.html>`_.

.. warning::

   Subscriptions will be available in lacinia-pedestal 0.3.0, which is not yet published.
