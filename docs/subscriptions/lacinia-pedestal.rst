Lacinia can only lay the foundation for subscriptions; the web tier must be involved to create the long-lived connections
to support server-side push.

.. warning::

   More details about how `lacinia-pedestal <https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal>`_ implements subscriptions is forthcoming.
