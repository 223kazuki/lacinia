## 0.14.0 -- 29 Mar 2017

This release adds some very small performance improvements.

Field resolver functions may now return sets (where the schema type is a list).
Previously this generated a runtime error.

There is a change to the signature of the
`com.walmartlabs.lacinia.executor/execute-query` function
that will not affect the majority of users.

We have removed an unused dependency on `org.clojure/tools.macro`.

And, of course, smaller fixes and improvements to the documentation.

## 0.13.0 -- 15 Mar 2017

Lucky 13 is our first publicly available version of Lacinia.
It is still alpha and still subject to change, however.
